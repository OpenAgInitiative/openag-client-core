# OpenAg Firmware

This directory contains a [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org) project that
allows you to compile firmware code for Arduino and other Microcontrollers.

We use the Arduino to talk to sensors and actuators.

## How to Use

- `scripts/gen_firmware_src`: generates source code and places it in `firmware/src`
